      How can you be sleeping, waves like weapons crash O'er us, cry for mercy
      and hold fast hope Who of us is cursed, or do we have to ask Search your
      souls and hold fast If no one speaks a word, then let the lots be cast
      Truth be told and hold fast White death wakes in black skies, mark your
      maker's wrath Fear and flames of azure climb the crooked the mast You will
      yet be baptized, steeped in shattered glass Sink and sing your answer and
      hold fast hope As strong arms grip your shoulders like dead hands of the
      past Pray as you're tossed over, this breath could be your last Quiet and
      cold, silent and slow Night black as coal, miles here below Find your
      faith and dive deep, through living gateways pass Lined with death and
      ivory, and hold fast, hold fast Deep beneath the black dawn, leagues from
      lightning's flash Ribs will raise cathedrals for the morning mass Steel
      yourself in sackcloth, roll your heart in ash Scrape your skin with steel
      wool and hold fast hope Cross your heart and hold fast hope
